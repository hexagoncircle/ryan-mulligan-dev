  "introduction": "<p>I'm a creative front-end engineer with over a decade of experience building for the web. I've developed a well-rounded skillset servicing both product and marketing teams. My back catalog of roles range from individual contribution to management, team building, and leadership.</p><p>I perpetually advocate for modern web standards, embrace the web platform, and believe in the rule of least powerâ€”use the simplest language to do the job well, then scale as it becomes necessary. My priorities are influenced by empathy: lift up those around me so we may succeed together, always care for the end user, and deliver a performant, inclusive, and accessible web.</p>",
