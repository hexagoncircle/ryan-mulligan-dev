My partner and I finally finished our epic three-part claymation saga. It's our first attempt at creating stop-motion videos with clay and it truly is _a lot_ of work for such a short result. [That claymation episode of Parks and Recreation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCUze7kuNas) is a little too real. I won't compare our movie to Avatar though.

Regardless, we had a blast doing it. Making art with our hands brings a different style of satisfaction. Anyway, I'll keep this post short and get to it. Enjoy!
