Last week I had made this fun little experiment. When clicking or tapping on the page, sparks (of joy) fly out from the mouse cursor/tap position. It started with me just messing around a bit in CodePen, but after sharing and getting a few friendly nudges on [my Mastodon post](https://mastodon.social/@hexagoncircle@fosstodon.org/111659424760546483), it has since evolved into a Web Component which is now available in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hexagoncircle/click-spark).

Try it out in the CodePen demo below.

{% codepen "https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/bGZdWyw" %}

The spark color can be customized by setting any color value to a `--click-spark-color` custom property. Have your sparks your way.
