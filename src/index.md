## A bit about me

I'm a fun-loving front-end engineer that strives to bridge the gap between web design and develop&shy;ment, building user experiences with positive interactivity through thoughtful interfaces. I advocate for modern best practices on the web and love working with diverse, inclusive teams.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me [noodling on my acoustic guitar](https://twitter.com/hexagoncircle/status/1413526995376295941?s=20") or [blasting out rhythms](https://twitter.com/hexagoncircle/status/1285798846568767496?s=20) if there's a drum kit ready for a lefty nearby.

## Current role

Notable work includes building our latest front-end design system, developing consumer-facing application workflows for our [Inspirato Pass](https://www.inspirato.com/pass/trips/) property listings and trip collections, and evolving our user experience to make a more stable, performant, and accessible product.

## Recent history

My time at [Expedia Group (Egencia)](https://www.egencia.com) had me focused on creating product prototypes concentrated around business travel consumer needs. Being involved in user studies helped guide a rapid, iterative process for UX feature A/B testing. I was a core member of the _Global UI Engineering Team_ and worked on the UI toolkit for our suite of applications. I led our internal _Front-end Improvements Team_ assisting product engineers with development direction and code contributions while advocating for quality and consistency in the presentation layer of our products.</p>

Soon after, I helped [Elevated Third](https://elevatedthird.com) start and manage their Seattle office. As a project development leader, I wrote build specs, estimated feature work, engaged directly with clients, and mentored junior team members.
