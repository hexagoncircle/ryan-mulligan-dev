## Blog posts

Sometimes general thoughts and rambles, mostly code snippets and front-end web discoveries that I want to share with you internet folks. Still in the process of writing content but I have a few in the cooker!

<ul>
  {%- for post in collections.posts | reverse  -%}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a>
      <span class="source">{{ post.data.date | postDate }}</span>
    </li>
  {%- endfor -%}
</ul>

## The bit about myself

I'm a fun-loving front-end engineer that strives to bridge the gap between web design and development, building user experiences with positive interactivity through thoughtful interfaces. I advocate for modern best practices on the web and love working with diverse, inclusive teams. Currently, I build for the web with a lovely team at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me [noodling on my acoustic guitar](https://twitter.com/hexagoncircle/status/1413526995376295941?s=20") or [blasting out rhythms](https://twitter.com/hexagoncircle/status/1285798846568767496?s=20) if there's a drum kit ready for a lefty nearby.
