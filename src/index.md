## A bit about me

I'm a fun-loving front-end engineer that strives to bridge the gap between web design and develop&shy;ment, building user experiences with positive interactivity through thoughtful interfaces. I advocate for modern best practices on the web and love working with diverse, inclusive teams. Currently, I build for the web with a lovely team at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me [noodling on my acoustic guitar](https://twitter.com/hexagoncircle/status/1413526995376295941?s=20") or [blasting out rhythms](https://twitter.com/hexagoncircle/status/1285798846568767496?s=20) if there's a drum kit ready for a lefty nearby.

## Blog posts

My own random thoughts, code snippets, and other web-related stuff I'd like to share out there. Still in the process of writing content but I have a few in the cooker!
