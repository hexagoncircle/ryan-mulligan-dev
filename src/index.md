## The bit about myself

I'm a fun-loving front-end engineer that strives to bridge the gap between web design and development, building user experiences with positive interactivity through thoughtful interfaces. I advocate for modern best practices on the web and love working with diverse, inclusive teams. Currently, I build for the web with a lovely team at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me [noodling on my acoustic guitar](https://twitter.com/hexagoncircle/status/1413526995376295941?s=20"){target="_blank" rel="me"} or [blasting out rhythms](https://twitter.com/hexagoncircle/status/1285798846568767496?s=20){target="_blank" rel="me"} if there's a drum kit ready for a lefty nearby.
