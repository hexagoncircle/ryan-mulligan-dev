  <h2>The bit about myself</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a fun-loving front-end engineer that strives to bridge the gap between web design and
    development, building user experiences with positive interactivity through thoughtful
    interfaces. I advocate for modern best practices on the web and love working with diverse,
    inclusive teams. Currently, I build for the web with a lovely team at Netlify. When I'm not
    coding, you can catch me noodling on my acoustic guitar or blasting out rhythms if there's a
    drum kit ready for a lefty nearby.
