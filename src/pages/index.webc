  This is a website made by me, <say-my-name></say-my-name>, a fellow passenger through space and
  time and front-end builder of the web. Some quick stats:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The latest build of this site deployed in the
    <span @text="timeOfDay" webc:nokeep></span> on <span @text="date" webc:nokeep></span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    During deployment, the weather over here was
    <span @text="$data.weather.temperature" webc:nokeep></span
    ><template webc:if="$data.weather.status" webc:nokeep>
      and <span @text="$data.weather.status" webc:nokeep></span></template
    >.

<h2>The bit about myself</h2>
<p>
  I'm a fun-loving front-end engineer that strives to bridge the gap between web design and
  development, building user experiences with positive interactivity through thoughtful interfaces.
  I advocate for modern best practices on the web and love working with diverse, inclusive teams.
  Currently, I build for the web with a lovely team at Netlify. When I'm not coding, you can catch
  me noodling on my acoustic guitar or blasting out rhythms if there's a drum kit ready for a lefty
  nearby.
